# BoxBrain Roadmap

## Now — Repository foundation

- Establish the canonical structure and source-of-truth rules.
- Register BrainConnect without copying its code or documentation.
- Add global indexes, dependency maps, validation, and session handoffs.
- Obtain the canonical remote URLs and ownership metadata.

## Completed — BrainConnect live events

- Authenticated first-message WebSocket connection
- Cursor resume and reconnect from the latest audit sequence
- HTTP polling fallback with sequence deduplication
- Browser-origin validation and local end-to-end verification

## Next — BrainConnect observation milestone

- Define target identity and allowlisting.
- Select one observation-only RDP or VNC adapter.
- Define capture retention and redaction rules.
- Keep keyboard, mouse, and shell execution disabled.

See the canonical [BrainConnect roadmap](../../BrainConnect/docs/ROADMAP.md).

## Later — Shared ecosystem services

- Establish AgentFramework contracts when a repository is authorized.
- Promote shared security controls into the Security project.
- Add reproducible Research benchmark definitions.
- Register WebsiteBuilder, Arkmatx, WebsiteCluster, and Automation sources as
  they are discovered.
- Prepare Docker, Raspberry Pi, VM, and cloud deployment tracks only after
  their software dependencies are proven.

## Long-term objective

Operate BoxBrain as a searchable, auditable coordination system for multiple
projects, models, agents, repositories, and deployment environments.
